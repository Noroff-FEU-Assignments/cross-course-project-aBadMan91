    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would start to tell them to do some research on threats like "Cross-Site scripting (XSS)", "SQL Injection", "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)" and other threats like "Clickjacking, Denial of Service, Directory Traversal, File Inclusion and Command Injection".</p>
    <p>Then I would make this small list:</p>
    <p>* Make sure that the «HTTPS» and «HSTS» is always used on your website.</p>
    <p>* Use better password management, the user should have to use letters like “!?#” in the password and numbers. The stronger the password the better. Make it possible to use two-factor authentication.</p>
    <p>* Tracking the most known or “popular” threats is important, they can be found on https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/ </p>
    <p>* You should use vulnerability scanning tools to check the security of your page. One example of those tools are https://pentest-tools.com/, you can find more on https://owasp.org/www-community/Vulnerability_Scanning_Tools.</p>
    <p>* You should only store data that you need. If you store sensitive data like a user’s credit card information you should never display the whole number, only the 4 last digits of the card should be visible so the user can still recognize the card information</p>
    <p>* You should always check and sanitize all data.</p>
